Brekel Kinect Pro Face is a Windows application that enables 3D animators to record and stream 3D face tracking of up to 6 people from your living room or office using a Kinect sensor[^1^]. It can track head position, rotation, and 20 different face shapes, including left and right asymmetry[^1^]. It can also export the data in various formats, such as FBX, BVH, PZ2, FSQ, TXT, and CSV[^1^].
 
Brekel Kinect Pro Face is compatible with Kinect for Windows v2 and Kinect for Xbox One sensors[^1^]. It requires a Windows 8 or higher operating system, a USB 3.0 port, a DirectX 11 capable GPU, 4 GB or more RAM, and a dual core 3.1Ghz i7/i5 CPU or equivalent[^1^]. It also supports streaming directly to Autodesk MotionBuilder, Unity3D, Unreal Engine 4, and other apps using OSC (Open Sound Control)[^1^].

Brekel Kinect Pro Face is a great tool for creating realistic and expressive facial animations for games, films, and other projects. However, some users may encounter problems with installing or activating the software. Some may also try to find a cracked version of the software online, which is illegal and risky. A cracked version of Brekel Kinect Pro Face may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your computer or compromise your personal information[^2^] [^3^]. Therefore, it is strongly advised to purchase a legitimate license from the official website of Brekel[^1^].
 
Brekel Kinect Pro Face is currently available for $99 USD for a single user license[^1^]. You can also download a trial version for free to test the software before buying it[^1^].

In this article, we will show you how to use Brekel Kinect Pro Face to create a simple facial animation. You will need a Kinect sensor, a Windows computer with Brekel Kinect Pro Face installed, and a 3D character model with blendshapes or morphs that match the face shapes tracked by the software. You can use any 3D software that supports importing FBX files, such as Maya, Blender, or 3ds Max.
 
First, launch Brekel Kinect Pro Face and connect your Kinect sensor to your computer. You should see a window with four tabs: Color, InfraRed, Depth, and Face. Select the Face tab and make sure that the sensor can detect your face. You should see a green mesh overlaying your face on the screen. You can adjust the smoothing and symmetry settings to improve the tracking quality.
 
Next, click on the Record button to start recording your facial expressions. You can also enable audio recording if you want to capture your voice. Try to make different expressions and move your head around. You can see the face shapes values changing on the right panel as you do so. When you are done, click on the Stop button to end the recording.
 
Now, you can export your recorded data as an FBX file. Click on the Export button and choose a location and a name for your file. You can also choose which data to include in the file, such as head position, rotation, face shapes, pointcloud, and audio. Click on OK to export the file.

Finally, you can import your FBX file into your 3D software and apply it to your character model. Make sure that your character model has blendshapes or morphs that correspond to the face shapes tracked by Brekel Kinect Pro Face. You can use the names of the face shapes as a reference. For example, Jaw\_Open corresponds to opening your mouth, Brow\_Down\_Left corresponds to lowering your left eyebrow, and so on. You can also adjust the scale and offset of the animation data to fit your character model better.
 
That's it! You have created a simple facial animation using Brekel Kinect Pro Face. You can play back your animation and see how your character mimics your expressions and movements. You can also edit or refine your animation further using your 3D software tools. Have fun experimenting with different expressions and characters!
