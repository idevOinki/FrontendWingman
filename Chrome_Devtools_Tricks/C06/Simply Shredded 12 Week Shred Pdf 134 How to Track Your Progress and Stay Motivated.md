## Step 3: Create a Bootable USB Drive with WinToFlash
 
Now that you have activated WinToFlash, you can use it to create a bootable USB drive from any Windows installation CD or ISO file. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert your USB drive into your computer and make sure it has enough free space to hold the Windows files. You may need to format it first if it has any existing data on it.
2. Insert your Windows installation CD into your CD/DVD drive or mount your Windows ISO file using a virtual drive software such as Daemon Tools.
3. Run WinToFlash and click on the Advanced Mode tab. You will see four options: Transfer Windows XP/2003 setup to USB drive, Transfer Windows Vista/7/8/10 setup to USB drive, Transfer Windows PE (BartPE based) to USB drive, and Create a Bootable MS-DOS USB drive.
4. Select the option that matches your Windows version and click Run.
5. You will see a wizard that will guide you through the process of transferring the Windows files to your USB drive. You will need to select the source (CD/DVD or ISO file) and the destination (USB drive) of the transfer.
6. Click Next and follow the instructions on the screen. The transfer may take several minutes depending on the size of your Windows files and the speed of your USB drive.
7. When the transfer is complete, click Next and then Exit. You have successfully created a bootable USB drive with WinToFlash.

## Step 4: Boot from Your USB Drive and Install Windows
 
To use your bootable USB drive to install Windows on your computer, you need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings so that your computer boots from the USB drive first instead of your hard disk.
 
To access your BIOS settings, restart your computer and press the appropriate key (usually F2, F10, F12, or Del) when you see the manufacturer's logo on the screen. You will see a menu with various options such as Main, Advanced, Boot, Security, etc.
