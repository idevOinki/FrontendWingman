## Step 1: Download the driver
 
The first step is to download the latest version of the 64 bit Syncrosoft driver Nuendo 3 from the official website of Steinberg. You can find the download link here: [https://www.steinberg.net/en/support/downloads\_hardware/syncrosoft\_driver.html](https://www.steinberg.net/en/support/downloads_hardware/syncrosoft_driver.html). Make sure you select the correct version for your operating system and architecture (Windows 11, 64 bit).
 
The file size of the driver is about 15 MB and it should take only a few minutes to download. Save the file to a location where you can easily access it later.
 
## Step 2: Run the installer
 
The next step is to run the installer of the 64 bit Syncrosoft driver Nuendo 3. To do this, locate the file you downloaded in the previous step and double-click on it. You may see a security warning from Windows asking you if you want to allow this app to make changes to your device. Click on "Yes" to proceed.
 
The installer will launch and display a welcome screen. Click on "Next" to continue. You will then see a license agreement screen. Read the terms and conditions carefully and click on "I accept" if you agree with them. Click on "Next" again.
 
You will then see an installation folder screen. Here you can choose where you want to install the driver on your computer. The default location is C:\Program Files\eLicenser\POS. We recommend that you keep this location unless you have a specific reason to change it. Click on "Next" again.
 
You will then see an installation confirmation screen. Here you can review your choices and make any changes if necessary. Click on "Install" to start the installation process.
 
## Step 3: Restart your computer
 
The final step is to restart your computer after the installation is complete. This is necessary for the driver to take effect and for Nuendo 3 to recognize it. The installer will prompt you to restart your computer when it finishes. Click on "Finish" and then click on "Yes" when asked if you want to restart now.
