## Step 1: Check Your Dongle Version
 
The first thing you need to do is to check what version of dongle you have. You can do this by looking at the color and shape of your dongle. There are three types of dongles for Gravostyle:
 
- Green dongle: This is the oldest type of dongle that works with Gravostyle 98 and earlier versions. It has a rectangular shape and a green label with the word "GravoStyle".
- Purple dongle: This is the second type of dongle that works with Gravostyle 5 and 6. It has a rectangular shape and a purple label with the word "GravoStyle".
- Black dongle: This is the newest type of dongle that works with Gravostyle 7 and 8. It has a round shape and a black label with the word "GravoStyle".

If you have a black dongle, you can skip to step 3. If you have a green or purple dongle, you need to upgrade to a black dongle before you can use Gravostyle 8.
 
## Step 2: Upgrade Your Dongle
 
To upgrade your dongle, you need to contact Gravograph, the company that makes Gravostyle. You can do this by visiting their website[^1^] or calling their customer service number[^2^]. You will need to provide them with some information about your engraver model, serial number, software version and dongle number. They will then send you a new black dongle and instructions on how to activate it.

## Step 4: Create a C2V File
