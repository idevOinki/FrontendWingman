Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India. He was a self-taught mathematical prodigy who had a natural intuition for numbers and formulas. He made remarkable contributions to various fields of mathematics, such as number theory, infinite series, partitions, and continued fractions. He also discovered many new theorems and identities that were later proven by other mathematicians.
 
Ramanujan's talent was recognized by G.H. Hardy, a professor at Cambridge University, who invited him to England in 1914. There, Ramanujan collaborated with Hardy and other eminent mathematicians, and published several papers in prestigious journals. He also became the first Indian to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of Trinity College.
 
However, Ramanujan's life was not easy. He faced many challenges, such as racism, culture shock, isolation, poverty, and ill health. He suffered from tuberculosis and malnutrition, and returned to India in 1919. He died on April 26, 1920, at the age of 32.
 
Ramanujan's legacy lives on in his notebooks, which contain hundreds of unpublished results and conjectures that are still being explored by mathematicians today. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time and an inspiration for generations of scientists and students.
  
What is The Man Who Knew Infinity about?
 
The Man Who Knew Infinity is a biographical drama film that tells the story of Ramanujan's life and his relationship with Hardy. The film is based on the book of the same name by Robert Kanigel, which was published in 1991. The film was directed by Matt Brown, who also wrote the screenplay. The film was shot in various locations in India and England, such as Chennai, Cambridge, Oxford, and London.
 
The film focuses on the contrast between Ramanujan's intuitive and spiritual approach to mathematics and Hardy's rigorous and formal approach. It also depicts the difficulties that Ramanujan faced as an outsider in a foreign land and as a genius in a conservative academic world. The film explores the themes of friendship, faith, culture, and creativity.
 
The film received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised the performances of Patel and Irons as well as the cinematography and the music. The film also won several awards, such as the Audience Award at the Zurich Film Festival and the Best Feature Film Award at the International Film Festival of India.
