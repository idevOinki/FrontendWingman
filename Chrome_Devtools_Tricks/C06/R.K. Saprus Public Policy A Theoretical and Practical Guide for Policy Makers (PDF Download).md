Some of the strengths of the book are its comprehensive coverage of the policy sciences, its use of Indian and international examples, and its clear and accessible language. The book provides a balanced and critical perspective on the various theories and models of public policy, and does not favor any particular approach or ideology. The book also highlights the challenges and opportunities of policy making in a complex and dynamic world, and suggests ways to improve the quality and effectiveness of public policies.
 
Some of the limitations of the book are its lack of empirical data and analysis, its tendency to repeat some concepts and arguments, and its outdated references and bibliography. The book could have benefited from more empirical evidence and case studies to support its claims and recommendations. The book could have also avoided some redundancy and repetition by organizing the chapters and sections more logically and coherently. The book could have also updated its references and bibliography to include more recent and relevant sources and publications.
 
Overall, Public Policy by R. K. Sapru is a valuable and informative book that offers a comprehensive introduction to the theory and practice of policy sciences. The book is suitable for anyone who wants to learn more about the process and outcomes of public policy making in India and elsewhere. The book is also a useful reference for those who are involved or interested in public policy as students, teachers, researchers or practitioners.
